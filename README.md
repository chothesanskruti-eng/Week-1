# Week-1
1)Dataset: Raw dataset used for preprocessing 
2)Week1.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with preprocessing steps.
  Preprocessing Steps Implemented :
  1) Handling missing valuess(removing, replacing with constant zero)
  2) Normaalization of numerical features
  3) Data cleaning for consistency
3)How to run
   1) Download or clone repository.
   2) Open th eipynb file in Jpyter Notebook(or Jupyter Lab / Goggle Colab).
